# Traktor F1 and Maschine MK3 controller access

This is a forked version of https://github.com/met5678/node-traktor-f1 with
the following changes:
- Minor bit-rot fixes and cleanup of things that appeared to be in-progress
  refactoring.
- Maschine MK3 support (currently in-progress)
- Some minimal attempts at making things slightly more generic.  There was
  already a forward-looking "traktor_f1_config.json", I'm just expanding on
  that, possibly in a silly way.
